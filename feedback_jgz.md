​
## Technical Requirements
​
**Performing**: nice work adding in 2 models here! posts, and comments, great job. I'd encourage you to keep pushing this and take it a little further! I see you have full CRUD for your posts, but it's hard to access, think about adding in some additional functionality there. Maybe think about a "favorites" tag, or "frequently used", as well?
​
## Creativity and Interface
​
**Performing**: Wow this looks great! I think adding in the links to get to posts, and edit/create posts would add a lot to user interface.
​
## Code Quality
​
**Progressing**: Please be really aware of indenting. It adds a lot to the way others can read your code.  I would also recommend keep css in the css file, and not doing in line styling. I've added in other notes in line for how to make the code more DRY and readable
​
## Deployment and Functionality
​
**Performing**: I think there is a bit of a disconnect between your deployed and local versions, as you mentioned in your comment. I suspect your css is not being compiled properly, and i suspect that is because your file is named application.css.erb. is there a reason you added the ".erb"?
​
## Planning / Process / Submission
​
**Performing**: The planning files look great! I like the ERD and wireframe.  I would encourage you to add two more things:
1. user stories
2. update your README with installation instructions and a description. this is super important for potential employers who might look at your code!
